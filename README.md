# Api-com-Python-Flask-

This API is a web application built on the Flask framework and uses SQLAlchemy to interact with a SQL database. The API allows users to register, log in, and obtain a JWT (JSON Web Token) token for authentication. CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations are supported for users, and JWT authentication is used to secure routes.
